# Avenue

## Tree Lane in Smolec Archery Park
In March 2024, we planted 18 red-leaved weeping beech trees in Smolec Archery Park, which together with educational plaques will present the history of world archery from the invention of the bow in Africa to the present day. This will be a journey through continents and civilizations for lovers of sport, military history, history and mythology. The bow and arrow are part of almost every culture, and thanks to their spread in the world of sports competition in various archery disciplines, they are also a platform for establishing international contacts and friendships.

The lane of planted trees, including 12-year-old beeches, will be an ornament to the archery ranges. In addition to 18 beeches, at position 12 in the lane grows a "self-seeded" tree – the native sessile oak Horacy, whose patron will be an icon of modern sport archery.

## History and Tree Patrons
Each tree will receive the name of a figure important to [world archery](archers.md). At each tree we will place an information plaque that will educate visitors about the history and significance of archery. Each tree is waiting for its caretaker, and donations made to the Student Sports Club Luks Smolec will serve to realize this intention, as well as to arrange and equip and operate Smolec Archery Park.

## Goal and Needs
Smolec Archery Park will become a place of recreation for residents, training archers and organizing sports competitions in archery and related disciplines such as run-archery. Our needs are enormous – apart from creating arrow traps and side shields, supplementing the area's fencing, equipping with a set of stands and mats, building paths on shooting lines – we also need to carry out a thorough renovation of two farm buildings on the plot transferred by Kąty Wrocławskie Municipality to the club on loan (for now until the end of 2028). These buildings may in the future constitute, in addition to sanitary and storage facilities, the first winter pavilion in Poland for practicing archery on outdoor ranges.

How Can You Help?
We encourage donations to the club's account at Nest Bank:
Account number: 73 2530 0008 2041 1071 4663 0001

We invite you to "buy your tree" for a minimum amount of PLN 10,000. Together we can create a unique place that will serve the community and archery lovers for many years.
