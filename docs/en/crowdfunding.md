# Financial Support

We started work on the archery park immediately after obtaining the right
to use the area in October 2023. During the first months, we intensively
cleaned, weeded and cleared the area. In the latter area, we also benefited
from the support of Smolec Osiedle Village Council (amount PLN 9,000). We
were also helped by the [Housing Management Board in Kąty Wrocławskie](https://zgmkwr.pl/),
especially in organizing the rubble within plot 480/4. We invested
significant club funds (over PLN 3,600 by the end of 2023 and over PLN
26,700 in 2024), as well as hundreds of hours of volunteer work by our
members. As a result, within stage 1 of work on the creation of Smolec
Archery Park, we prepared a water and sewage connection to the facility,
carried out planned vegetation cutting and agreed replacement plantings
in the form of Archers Avenue.

In 2024, with the support of the [Marshal's Office of Lower Silesia
Voivodeship](https://umwd.dolnyslask.pl/), we implemented a task called "Smolec Archery Park,
stage 2A" with a budget of over PLN 134,000, under the "Sports Base
Improvement" program. As part of this project, we performed drainage of
archery ranges, an arrow trap wall, side safety shields, purchased an
arrow trap net and repaired existing fences and supplemented those that
were missing. In implementing this task, we were greatly helped by
companies [Wiązar Plus](https://wiazar-plus.pl/), Skandha, Wrocław Aggregates, Gerpol and many
private donors.

Thanks to the support of [Gminę Kąty Wrocławskie](https://www.katywroclawskie.pl/) - during the
implementation of the above task - we implemented the creation of a
recreational clearing for residents as part of a local initiative (task
budget over PLN 18,000). The area of future archery ranges was
cultivated, stones, debris remains, scrap metal, glass and garbage were
removed from it and it was sown with grass. The rains that caused the
2024 Lower Silesian flood, in our case contributed to the fact that
already in October we could enjoy a wonderful lawn on future archery
ranges.

April 1, 2025 (this is not April Fools!) the first archery training took
place in Smolec Archery Park, and on April 3, 2025 we also inaugurated
running training in Smolec park of the run archery section (the first in
Poland!). Currently we want to implement further stages of this
undertaking. We still need at least PLN 200,000 to equip the facility
with comfortable and leveling gravel paths and lighting that will allow
us to extend the archery season on outdoor ranges. We also need permanent
sanitary facilities, changing rooms for athletes, technical facilities
and shelter from the hot sun or rain during training and competitions.

We count on the support of everyone who cares about physical culture and
the possibility of active outdoor recreation. We have launched a permanent
fundraising campaign on [zrutka.pl](https://zrzutka.pl/44kzzx), and we would like to talk about
possible greater help with each person individually.
