After three years of efforts, [Uczniowski Klub Sportowy Luks Smolec](https://uksluks.pl) obtained the right to use the area in October 2023, which has the potential to become the heart of the club's activities. It was lent until the end of 2028 by [Gminę Kąty Wrocławskie](https://www.katywroclawskie.pl) to serve both us and the residents of Smolec!

The area with a total surface of 9,065 m² has been designated for the construction of a sports and recreational facility called ***Smolec Archery Park***. It consists of a larger plot *no. 481*, where we set up archery ranges, and a smaller plot *no. 480/4*, built with former farm buildings that have the potential to become the club's headquarters in the future. The area directly adjoins the Smolec Palace Park, whose planned revitalization by Kąty Wrocławskie Municipality in 2024 allowed the creation of the world's first arena dedicated to practicing run-archery. You can learn about the history of the work in the [blog](/blog/2023/09/30/nowe-tory-lucznicze-w-smolcu/) in PL language.

Regular archery and running training began at the beginning of April 2025. Group training takes place on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM (more information about training on the [UKS Luks](https://uksluks.pl/treningi/) website). Anyone can try archery, because it's a sport for people of all ages and almost any health condition without an expensive "entry threshold" – we invite you to contact the coordinator trainer of [the given section](https://uksluks.pl/kontakt/) and read the answers to [frequently asked questions](https://uksluks.pl/faq-czyli-najczesciej-zadawane-pytania/). On other days of the week, athletes train individually, we also organize archery training for smaller and larger organized groups. We are also open to all initiatives of Smolec residents – we cooperate with villages, non-governmental organizations and informal groups. Just contact us to arrange the date and scope of facility use!

The first sports competition in Smolecki Archery Park is the 4th Round of the Three Nations Cup Run Archery on June 21, 2025. More about competitions and the run archery section can be found on our dedicated [run archery](https://runarchery.pl/) website. As the facility is equipped, target archery competitions of increasingly higher rank will also take place here.
