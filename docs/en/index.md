# About project

After three years of efforts, [Uczniowski Klub Sportowy Luks Smolec](https://uksluks.pl) in October 2023 obtained the right to use the area, which has a chance to become the heart of the club's activities. It was lent until the end of 2028 by the [Kąty Wrocławskie Commune](https://www.katywroclawskie.pl) to serve both us and the residents of Smolec!

The area with a total area of ​​9,065 m² was intended for the construction of a sports and recreational facility called ***Smolecki Park Łuczniczy***. It consists of a larger plot *no. 481*, where we arrange archery tracks, and a smaller plot *no. 480/4*, developed with former farm buildings, which have the potential to become the club's headquarters in the future. The area is directly adjacent to the Smolensk palace park, the planned revitalization of which by the Kąty Wrocławskie Commune will create the world's first arena dedicated to running archery.

We follow the example of [the archery park in Larnaca, Cyprus](https://larnakaregion.com/pyla-hits-the-bullseye-with-archery-park) - a center used by Polish national team players. We want to create in Smolec the most modern facility in Poland, fully adapted to the needs of athletes with disabilities, including those using wheelchairs.
