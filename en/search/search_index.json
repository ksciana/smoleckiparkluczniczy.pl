The area directly adjoins the Smolec Palace Park, whose planned revitalization by K\u0105ty Wroc\u0142awskie Municipality in 2024 allowed the creation of the world's first arena dedicated to practicing run-archery.

During the first months, we intensively cleaned, weeded and cleared the area. In the latter area, we also benefited from the support of Smolec Osiedle Village Council (amount PLN 9,000). We were also helped by the Housing Management Board in K\u0105ty Wroc\u0142awskie, especially in organizing the rubble within plot 480/4. We invested significant club funds (over PLN 3,600 by the end of 2023 and over PLN 26,700 in 2024), as well as hundreds of hours of volunteer work by our members. As a result, within stage 1 of work on the creation of Smolec Archery Park, we prepared a water and sewage connection to the facility, carried out planned vegetation cutting and agreed replacement plantings in the form of Archers Avenue.</p> <p>In 2024, with the support of the Marshal's Office of Lower Silesia Voivodeship, we implemented a task called \"Smolec Archery Park, stage 2A\" with a budget of over PLN 134,000, under the \"Sports Base Improvement\" program. As part of this project, we performed drainage of archery ranges, an arrow trap wall, side safety shields, purchased an arrow trap net and repaired existing fences and supplemented those that were missing. In implementing this task, we were greatly helped by companies Wi\u0105zar Plus, Skandha, Wroc\u0142aw Aggregates, Gerpol and many private donors.</p> <p>Thanks to the support of Gmin\u0119 K\u0105ty Wroc\u0142awskie - during the implementation of the above task - we implemented the creation of a recreational clearing for residents as part of a local initiative (task budget over PLN 18,000). The area of future archery ranges was cultivated, stones, debris remains, scrap metal, glass and garbage were removed from it and it was sown with grass. The rains that caused the 2024 Lower Silesian flood, in our case contributed to the fact that already in October we could enjoy a wonderful lawn on future archery ranges.</p> <p>April 1, 2025 (this is not April Fools!) the first archery training took place in Smolec Archery Park, and on April 3, 2025 we also inaugurated running training in Smolec park of the run archery section (the first in Poland!). Currently we want to implement further stages of this undertaking. We still need at least PLN 200,000 to equip the facility with comfortable and leveling gravel paths and lighting that will allow us to extend the archery season on outdoor ranges. We also need permanent sanitary facilities, changing rooms for athletes, technical facilities and shelter from the hot sun or rain during training and competitions.</p> <p>We count on the support of everyone who cares about physical culture and the possibility of active outdoor recreation.

The first results of the work are presented by the following visualizations and floor plans of individual floors of both buildings. The concept assumes the reconstruction of farm buildings in their original spatial proportions while preserving gable roofs and architectural details, e.g. fragments of stone wall in the building adjacent to plot 481 (north wall - on the plot boundary - and east), original roof covering and use of original brick. Full accessibility of buildings for people with mobility disabilities is planned through the construction of a ramp and a gallery along the first floor and a footbridge connecting both buildings. On plot 481, the construction of a seasonal walking shelter in light construction, not permanently connected to the ground, is planned, which thanks to a glazing system will refer to the greenhouse that existed before the war in the park and palace complex. We assume the possibility of setting up a \"winter garden\" in it (sensitive plants will be able to be stored in the shelter during winter, and then transported in pots to the archery ranges for the summer season) and a \"winter pavilion\" for archers (possibility of training all year round). Equipping the northern slope of the shelter with a tribune with two rows of seats for a total of 120 places will enable safe and comfortable participation in sports and recreational events for the audience.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The following part of the visualization presents the current state of neighboring buildings and visualizations of the object taking into account the remains of the palace and farm complex in Smolec.
